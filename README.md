# primecrypt
This is a Python-based Caesar Cipher toolkit built for cybersecurity encryption and decryption tasks.

By the way, welcome to my mini cybersecurity project! This Python-based CLI app allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm which is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.

## Features

- Caesar Cipher encryption
- Caesar Cipher decryption
- Time-based challenge mode (mini game-style!)
- Test your decryption skills under pressure
- User-friendly and beginner-friendly terminal interface

## By the way, What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a **substitution cipher** where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example:  
With a shift of 3, `A` becomes `D`, `B` becomes `E`, etc.

## How to Use

### 🖥️ Run the program:
```bash
python3 caesar_cipher.py
You'll be greeted with options to:

Encrypt a message

Decrypt a message

Try out the challenge mode 🕹️


Just follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the CLI.

🧪 Example Usage

Encrypt a Message

Enter your message: hello
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted message: khoor

Decrypt a Message

Enter encrypted message: khoor
Enter shift value: 3
Decrypted message: hello

Try Challenge Mode

You’ll have a few seconds to decrypt a secret message — ready to test your hacker instincts?
